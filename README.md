# Chicago-Traffic-Violations

### Project Overview
The goal was to create a set of visualizations about the traffic cameras in Chicago intended for the Mayor of Chicago. The project included downloading the data from the City of Chicago's Website and understanding the information provided: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4/data. 

Then the first round of data visualizations were intended to explore the data set using Tableau and then further developing an analysis to present based on that exploration.
